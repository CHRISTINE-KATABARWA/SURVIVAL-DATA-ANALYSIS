A comprehensive analysis of survival data using classical and modern biostatistical methods.
This project demonstrates my skills in survival modelling, model diagnostics, reproducible workflows, and interpretation of time-to-event data.

OVERVIEW

This repository contains my full analysis of the Hodgkin lymphoma survival dataset, using both Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) and Proportional Hazards (PH) models.
The workflow includes:

Data cleaning and preparation

Exploratory survival analysis

Fitting AFT and PH models

Comparing parametric distributions

Diagnostic checks (residuals, Cox–Snell plots)

Model selection using AIC/BIC

Interpretation of results in a clinical context

Reproducible R scripts and visualizations

This repository reflects practical biostatistical skills commonly used in clinical research, epidemiology, and real-world evidence analysis.
